Scenario 1: Division by a non-zero value
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_non_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the divide function correctly performs division when the divisor is non-zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(10, 2).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure basic functionality of the divide function under normal conditions. This test validates that the function performs correct arithmetic operations.

Scenario 2: Division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_zero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the divide function when the divisor is zero to ensure it returns an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(10, 0).
  Assert: The result should be "Division by zero."
Validation:
  This test ensures that the divide function handles division by zero gracefully, preventing runtime errors and providing a clear error message.

Scenario 3: Division of negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the divide function correctly handles the division of negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(-10, -2).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly performs division with negative operands, which is crucial for mathematical accuracy.

Scenario 4: Division of zero by a non-zero number
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_zero_by_non_zero
  Description: This test ensures that the divide function returns zero when the dividend is zero and the divisor is non-zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(0, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  This test validates that dividing zero by any non-zero number results in zero, adhering to mathematical principles.

Scenario 5: Division of large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_large_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle large numerical values without losing precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(1000000, 100).
  Assert: The result should be 10000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers accurately, which is important for applications requiring precise calculations with large datasets.

Scenario 6: Division of floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the divide function correctly handles floating-point numbers, ensuring the result is as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(7.5, 2.5).
  Assert: The result should be 3.0.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function manages floating-point arithmetic accurately, which is vital for scientific and engineering computations.

Scenario 7: Division of mixed positive and negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_mixed_numbers
  Description: This test assesses the function's behavior when dividing a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(10, -2).
  Assert: The result should be -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles mixed positive and negative operands, which is essential for various mathematical applications.

Scenario 8: Division with large result
Details:
  TestName: test_divide_large_result
  Description: This test checks the function's capability to manage divisions that yield very large results.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call divide(1000000000, 0.0001).
  Assert: The result should be 10000000000000.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can handle divisions resulting in extremely large values, ensuring it does not overflow or lose precision.
